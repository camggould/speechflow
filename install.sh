#!/usr/bin/env sh
# speechflow installer — downloads the right pre-built binary from GitHub Releases.
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camggould/speechflow/main/install.sh | sh
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | sh -s -- --version v0.2.0
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | sh -s -- --prefix ~/.local/bin
#
# What it does (and what it doesn't):
# - Detects the host OS (linux/darwin) and architecture (amd64/arm64).
# - Resolves the latest published release, or the explicit --version.
# - Downloads the matching tarball + its .sha256, verifies, extracts,
#   and installs to /usr/local/bin (or --prefix).
# - Falls back to ~/.local/bin without sudo if /usr/local/bin isn't
#   writable.
# - Verifies the install by running `speechflow version`.
#
# Does NOT install Go, Node, npm, or any other build tooling.
# The speechflow binary ships everything it needs (UI is embedded;
# SQLite with FTS5 is statically linked; no runtime deps beyond libc).
